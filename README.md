# Bratan: C Utility Library Collection

A collection of **header-only C utility libraries** designed to streamline common programming tasks. These libraries offer clean, self-contained implementations without the need for manual compilation or linking of separate source files.

## Content

* `./data_structures/linkedlist_t` – this is a generic **singly linked list implementation**.
* `./data_structures/queue_t` – This is a generic, singly linked list-based queue implementation that supports O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations.
* `string_t` – same but with strings.
